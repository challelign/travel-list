<button onClick={onDeleteItem(item.id)}>❌</button>
<button onClick={()=> onDeleteItem(item.id)}>❌</button>
The first line of code uses a function call to onDeleteItem(item.id) when the button is clicked.
This means that the
onDeleteItem function is executed immediately when the button is rendered, not when it is clicked.
This can cause
unintended behavior, such as deleting the item without the user actually clicking the button.

The second line of code uses an arrow function to wrap the onDeleteItem(item.id) function call.
This means that the
onDeleteItem function will only be executed when the button is clicked.
This is the correct way to handle events in
React, as it ensures that the function is only executed when the event occurs.

Therefore, the second line of code is the recommended approach for handling events in React.
